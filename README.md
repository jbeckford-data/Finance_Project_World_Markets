# Finance_Project_World_Markets

""" Final Project:<br>
 1: Download data  for 25 years for global markets<br>
 2: Check if prices follow a log-normal distribution<br>
 3: Check if returns follow a normal distribution<br>
 4: For prices and returns come up with specific statistical measure that identifies<br>
 the degree of deviation from the ideal distribution.  Graph represent the degree of correspondence.<br>
 5: Random walk: Assuming geometric Brownian and 20% historical volatility write a sub-module<br>
 to calculate the event like the 1987 crash.  Explain in simple terms what the results imply.<br>
 6: What does "Fat tail" mean? Plot the distribution of price movement.<br>
 7: Claim is that fractal and multi-fractals generate a more realistic picture of market<br>
 risks than log-normal.  Considering the last 10 years of NASDAQ, write a program to check whether<br>
 fractal geometry could have better predicted market movements than log-normal.  Explain with graphs.<br>
